/* Version: 2.1.5
 * Creator: Fridan99
 * Macro name: Beshaba and Tymora's Fate 
 * Create a script macro, copy, paste and let the party begin
 * Select the tokens you want to involve in a possible target, run the macro, and the name of the randomly chosen token will appear. 
 * There are 1 part that have a delay of 0,5 sec (500 msec), modify the milliseconds to suit your needs.
 * Now you can see the images of the selected tokens in the chat instead of their names. 
 * If you click on the image of a token in the chat, the screen is centered over that token and a ping is sent on that token.
